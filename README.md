# Minecraft Boulders Datapack

Add terrain-aware boulders to your Minecraft world with this data pack! Boulders naturally scale with terrain height - larger boulders appear in mountainous regions while flat areas remain mostly boulder-free.

## Features

- 🏔️ **Terrain-Aware Generation**: Boulders scale with terrain height using Minecraft's noise patterns
- 🪨 **Three Boulder Sizes**: Small, medium, and large boulders for variety
- 🎲 **Natural Variation**: Multiple stone types (stone, cobblestone, andesite, granite, diorite, mossy cobblestone)
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Easily adjust spawn rates, sizes, and biome restrictions
- 🌍 **Performance Optimized**: Minimal impact on world generation
- 🔧 **Noise-Based Density**: Uses custom density functions that read terrain patterns

## Quick Start

1. Download the datapack (or clone this repository)
2. Copy to your world's `datapacks` folder
3. Run `/reload` in-game
4. Verify with `/datapack list`

For detailed installation instructions, see the [full documentation](docs/README.md).
